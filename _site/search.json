This experience ties into my project work, such as analyzing the impact of Airbnb listings on New York Cityâ€™s housing market and studying academic performance disparities in Iowa schools. Through these projects, I employed R for intricate data cleaning and Tableau for insightful visualizations, demonstrating the practical application of my data science skills to real-world problems."
